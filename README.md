**CodeRadar** is a GIT repository analyzer that retrieves information about file activity and file "ownership".

## Building

```bash
./build.sh
```

After the script is done a self-contained binary will be generated under `target/code-radar`

## Running

If your current path is a GIT repository just running `code-radar` will analyze de current's path repository.

```
code-radar
```

Alternatively, you can run the application with a remote repository. The application will clone this into memory (so no artifacts will be created in your system).

```
code-radar <GIT repository URL>
```

Another option is running the application with a local repository but in a different path location:

```
code-radar --local <Local repository path>
```

By default `code-radar` will choose a free open port. You can force the port with the flag `--port`

```
code-radar --port 8000
```

After the repository is analyzed you can navigate to the URL shown in the terminal to check the results.

```bash
2021/07/23 11:12:42 Init local repository .
2021/07/23 11:12:42 [START] Processing repository
2021/07/23 11:15:09 [END] Processing repository
2021/07/23 11:15:09 Listening on: http://localhost:44103
```

## Development

For development you should run both client and server in different command lines.

### Client

```
cd front
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Server

```
cd back
go run cmd/code-radar/main.go
```

You alternative can use [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) to start a live-reload server.

```
cd back
air
```
