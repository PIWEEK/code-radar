**CodeRadar** is a GIT repository analyzer that retrieves information about file activity and file "ownership".

## Build and run

```bash
./build.sh
```

After the script is done a self-contained binary will be generated under `target/code-radar`

You can run the binary with:

```
code-radar <GIT repository URL>
```

Alternative you can run the application with a local repository with:

```
code-radar --local <Local repository path>
```

By default `code-radar` will choose a port open. You can force the port with the flag `--port`

```
code-radar --port 8000
```


## Development

For development you should run both client and server in different command lines.

### Client

```
cd front
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Server

```
cd back
go run cmd/code-radar/main.go
```

You alternative can use [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) to start a live-reload server.

```
cd back
air
```
